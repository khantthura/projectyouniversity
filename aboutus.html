                <p class="box-text"> Our developer team is formed with students from the first year of UIT. We have also dealt with ample challenges through deciding which university to choose after the matriculation exam. Therefore, our group got an idea to create a website that would help out these students by providing clear and easily accessible information of the universities. Hence, with our very best efforts, we have created this handy website.
